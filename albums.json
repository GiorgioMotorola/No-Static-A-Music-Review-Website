    "review": "This is, at the time, the biggest band attempting to experiment with their sound. It's a perfect example of artistic integrity being chaotically held within the frame of being the biggest band in the world. It's somehow a post-punk album that was raised by standard album-oriented rock music, who got to visit Uncle Byrne and Aunt Cocaine on the weekends. Stressful but peaceful like a hurricane on a paradisiacal island.\n\nIt starts out unassuming with \"Over & Over,\" which sounds exactly like sitting in an old person's Mercury Grand Prix with the air conditioning blowing. That old person is your grandmother, and you are waiting for her to finish up at the yard sale on a Sunday afternoon. The day is filled with suburban adventure, and maybe you'll get some Red Lobster after it's over.\n\nI try to imagine a Rumors fan putting this album on and going from \"Over & Over\" to \"The Ledge\" and hearing what sounds like a Daniel Johnston pop shop, then throwing the album in the trash. There isn't a wasted second on this thing when it comes to oddness. It's pop/soft rock adjacent. I doubt even the band knew it at that time. Just a bunch of sex freaks from the UK and the US trying to follow up one of the biggest albums ever.\n\nCome to think of it, the entire album sort of oozes this quality, the air conditioner/grandma rubric I served up earlier. Remember? Anyway, it's a sort of safety that only a guy who loves powdery drugs and the Talking Heads, and a band game for anything can present to you. I know a lot of folk will often talk ad nauseum about Fleetwood Mac's friction as a band based on their promiscuity toward each other, but none of that comes through for me on this album. This album feels like a band trying to expand with the times and somehow sounding bright and clean.\n\nI don't know, man, I've been thinking about this album for years. It's my all-time favorite.",

    "review": "I could give you 500 years and a Spotify premium membership, and I doubt you'll find a better album opener than \"AH!\" The only other opening line I can think of right now is \"...and then we all bought yaaaaaaaachts\" from Highly Refined Pirates by Minus the Bear. And David Byrne doing his best half-assed impression of Kathy from the hit newspaper comic strip \"Kathy\" still wins from a \"brevity is the soul of wit\" kind of place. My first experience with Talking Heads was Napster. I was in high school, and I was going through my mandatory Radiohead phase. This was before Radiohead did the Bomb the Music Industry model of pay anything, so I had to download all of the songs I wanted when the titles looked like an Aphex Twin tracklist. I suppose any Talking Heads fan can guess where this is going: they have a song called Radio Head, Radiohead's band name is Radiohead... you get it. So naturally, that is the first Talking Heads song I remember hearing. A fine start, I suppose. It wasn't until a bit later in life that I actually sat my Radiohead ass down and listened. I am pretty sure I spent a summer listening to the aforementioned Remain in Light, Speaking in Tongues, Fear of Music, et al., and every note on these albums still sounds so fresh to this day. Not to mention the fact that just hearing David Byrne's voice at any point immediately puts me in a great recordedIn. His direct, reading a newspaper delivery is built into my bones. Good band.",

    "review": "I am sometimes guilty of hearing an album I like and proclaiming it as one of the all-time greats. I don't know, blame it on needing something or someone to love me back, or blame it on 38 years of trying to figure out a way to wrap my bones and skin around a certain sound or album. Maybe blame it on the rain, maybe not—blame it on the rain... Maybe fuck yaself. (Reviewer's note: 'Blame It On The Rain' is a 1989 song by the pop group Milli Vanilli, who were outed to be lip-syncing all of their music. But the best fact about them is that when I googled this song to get the year released, the genres were listed as R&B, Soul, and Halloween Music.) Anyway, I say all of this because this was very much one of these types of albums. I put this on while playing PGA2K22 one Sunday afternoon in between Gravediggaz's '6 Feet Deep' and some Steve Roach album about space or the weather and was completely taken over by how warm and mysterious this project was. This is an album I for sure tried to fit my bones and skin around and instead, the dang album decided to mutate with my entire being. I distinctly remember going back again and again and again to restart the album only to finally just double-tap the button on Spotify to play it on repeat. Since then, I have walked to work in 20-degree weather to this album, I have lied in bed daydreaming about anything in the world to this album... I have even run to this album which is truly psychotic. It may not be for people who have yet accepted ambient music as a genre (I am terrified of my friend TJ listening to this, who is one of the greatest people ever but has yet to come to the side of ambient being an essential genre) but if you have a taste for wavy, warm, deep, and sounds that make you blame everything on the rain for making you like ambient, then you'll love this son of a bitch.",

    "review": "These days, there are tons of bands that deliberately try to make it impossible to search for them on Google. Real Estate, !!!, Tennis, Perfect Pussy (that last one is a tough one to explain to your family). To this day, I am hard pressed to understand why outside of trying to sound cool. But what's less cool than trying to dodge people trying to find tour dates when they can just type 'Man Man band' and find it easy. (funny story: I googled 'bands with hard names to search for' for this and accidentally searched for 'beans* with hard names to search for' and now I am looking at an AllRecipes article about types of beans. Did you know it was NOT spelled Kid Knee Bean??!). So, Television. If I type that into a search engine, I get Best Buy and Amazon ads about the newest flat as hell and bigger than all of Lord's creation for sale for $10,000 dollars. But Television to me is a band so ahead of its time, they could be mistaken for the new post-rock revival. Seriously, try it. Find a friend who doesn't know who Television is and say 'bro this is the new up and coming rock group. They are gonna blow your mind. They are called Ham Salad.' Ok Enough farting around. Television is incredible. At least this album is. I do very much like their other albums but this one is close proof that God exists and he is alright with a member named Richard Hell (sorry for cursing again) once being in the band. Maybe he decided to work at sending his God-like magic to the band after Richard Hell (sorry for cursing again) left. Who knows. I am not a Priest (another good impossible search engine band). Either way, this is a band for everyone. They lie in a middle ground where jaded dorks like me and the rest of the non-jaded cool people out there can enjoy it all the same. Seriously, try it. Tell your dad who loves Dire Straits (who doesn't) and Steely Dan (seriously, who doesn't?) that this is a new band called Ham Planet and the Salads or something and soon enough, you and him will be drinking a Modelo and grilling up hot dogs.",

    "review": "The guy on the cover of this album is holding his weiner, right? Is it supposed to mean the power of his manhood lives in his \"mic\"? I am going to say that is the case. I came to A Tribe Called Quest later in life through a friend who said they were his favorite group of all time. Don't get me wrong: I certainly have always enjoyed their music at parties while drunk and in the backseat of cars while drunk etc etc etc. I think what really start to believe they were one of the best hip hop groups of all time was on a sunny Saturday morning during a 5 mile run. I was at mile 2 and really struggling to get a good pace going. I pulled up a mix I made and it happened to have \"Steve Biko (Stir It Up)\" on it. From mile 2 on, I had figurative motors inside of my shoes. Everything on their albums, especially Midnight Marauders, fits perfectly together like the components that would make up a figurative motor you would put in a shoe or shoes to go fast. It's groups like A Tribe Called Quest that make me question people who say Taylor Swift is the greatest artist ever. I mean, I like some of those Taylor songs but what the fuck does she know about Maurading?! Look, I understand that some might think a guy talking about an album that has a guy rockin a piss from his microphone weiner and comparing it to Taylor Swift might be \"problematic\" and maybe it is. Does it make you feel any better to say Taylor Swift was the computerized woman in the interludes? Thats not true. Ok enough kidding around I am just being a silly guy. What a great album, stream Midnight Maruaders on itunes now.",
