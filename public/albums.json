    "review": "This is, at the time, the biggest band attempting to experiment with their sound. It's a perfect example of artistic integrity being chaotically held within the frame of being the biggest band in the world. It's somehow a post-punk album that was raised by standard album-oriented rock music, who got to visit Uncle Byrne and Aunt Cocaine on the weekends. Stressful but peaceful like a hurricane on a paradisiacal island.\n\nIt starts out unassuming with \"Over & Over,\" which sounds exactly like sitting in an old person's Mercury Grand Prix with the air conditioning blowing. That old person is your grandmother, and you are waiting for her to finish up at the yard sale on a Sunday afternoon. The day is filled with suburban adventure, and maybe you'll get some Red Lobster after it's over.\n\nI try to imagine a Rumors fan putting this album on and going from \"Over & Over\" to \"The Ledge\" and hearing what sounds like a Daniel Johnston pop shop, then throwing the album in the trash. There isn't a wasted second on this thing when it comes to oddness. It's pop/soft rock adjacent. I doubt even the band knew it at that time. Just a bunch of sex freaks from the UK and the US trying to follow up one of the biggest albums ever.\n\nCome to think of it, the entire album sort of oozes this quality, the air conditioner/grandma rubric I served up earlier. Remember? Anyway, it's a sort of safety that only a guy who loves powdery drugs and the Talking Heads, and a band game for anything can present to you. I know a lot of folk will often talk ad nauseum about Fleetwood Mac's friction as a band based on their promiscuity toward each other, but none of that comes through for me on this album. This album feels like a band trying to expand with the times and somehow sounding bright and clean.\n\nI don't know, man, I've been thinking about this album for years. It's my all-time favorite.",

    "review": "One of the funniest things I have ever read in a book was in the Replacements biography Troubled Boys. Maybe I'll tell you about it one day. Ok, I'll tell you now. Paul Westerberg, 1/4th of the Troubled Boys and all-around genius, talks about a time he was at Prince's recording studio and Ray Charles' daughter stopped by for one reason or another. He struck up a conversation and mentioned that he had been working on a song that he thought her father, Ray Charles, would be a good fit for. He continues to pitch the idea to her, and the entire time, she is uncomfortable with the entire idea. So Paul decides to drop it and on the day goes. Later that night, he recalls, he was in a bar bathroom and it clicked why Ray Charles' daughter seemed so turned off with the idea of her father performing a song he wrote: the song in question was called \"They're Blind\". And if you don't get why that is funny, then you need to go to Ray Charles' school. And if you are currently in Ray Charles' school and you're still having trouble comprehending why that anecdote is hilarious, then I would like to speak with the teaching administration; they are not doing their job. The Replacements are my favorite band of all time. Have been for a while. And before that, they were ONE of my favorite bands of all time. I think they got the top place when I realized I love an underdog story. I love Tom Scharlping of The Best Show fame, who is the champion underdog. I love the New Pornographers song Ballad of a Comeback Kid because it conveys the true spirit of an underdog fighting their way through adversity and maybe they don't reach the end goal, but they sure as hell didn't go out like a bitch. I love hot dogs. I love dogs. I didn't know this growing up at all, but a couple of years ago, I found out my dad's favorite band is The Replacements as well, so all the more reason to keep them at the top spot. I think The Mats embody the American spirit of being born in a country that, albeit is pretty great at times but sure can be tough for a lot of folk right out the gate. They should have been the biggest band in the world or at least the biggest band in the 80's but they couldn't get out of their own way. But I guess that's the true underdog spirit, I guess. Sometimes the underdog doesn't know how far they can go until it's too late and they are asking the daughter of one of the greatest musicians of all time if their blind father wanted to song about being blind. Funny guys. Amazing band. Go listen to Let It Be by The Mats.",

    "review": "I am starting to notice a trend in some of my favorite albums ever: underdogs. Big Star is no exception. They made three truly perfect records; one of their members died in a car accident after releasing a truly near-perfect album, and then Alex Chilton became a really weird guy and started washing dishes in New Orleans. Then he died. Then another died. We all die, I suppose. Well, not me. I'm gonna live forever. A lot of people will tell you that the first Big Star album, #1 Record, is their best. Again, it's perfect, but Radio City is more perfect. Twelve wonderful, truly breathtaking Power Pop songs made before Power Pop was a thing. And on top of that, a hot contender for one of the ten best songs ever is on this thing. If you have listened to September Gurls, you know what I mean. I feel like I am a small-time grocery store clerk with big dreams and aspirations when I listen to this thing. I clock out at 9 pm on a Friday night, get into my friend's rusted-out Chevy, he hands me a beer, and we go look for a place with hot babes. The guitar tone on here is the most satisfying jangle ever put to tape, sounding like a patio beer or falling in love for the first time. The energy put into this thing and the low reception it got on release really make you admire the fight these guys had to have had to continue on and make a really weird but very perfect third album (minus 2 members) aptly titled Third/Sister Lovers. If you need a pick-me-up, this is the band and THIS is THE album.",

And David Byrne doing his best half-assed impression of Kathy from the hit newspaper comic strip \"Kathy\" still wins from a \"brevity is the soul of wit\" kind of place. My first experience with Talking Heads was Napster. I was in high school, and I was going through my mandatory Radiohead phase. This was before Radiohead did the Bomb the Music Industry model of pay anything, so I had to download all of the songs I wanted when the titles looked like an Aphex Twin tracklist. I suppose any Talking Heads fan can guess where this is going: they have a song called Radio Head, Radiohead's band name is Radiohead... you get it. So naturally, that is the first Talking Heads song I remember hearing. A fine start, I suppose. It wasn't until a bit later in life that I actually sat my Radiohead ass down and listened. I am pretty sure I spent a summer listening to the aforementioned Remain in Light, Speaking in Tongues, Fear of Music, et al., and every note on these albums still sounds so fresh to this day. Not to mention the fact that just hearing David Byrne's voice at any point immediately puts me in a great recordedIn. His direct, reading a newspaper delivery is built into my bones. Good band.",

    "review": "I am sometimes guilty of hearing an album I like and proclaiming it as one of the all-time greats. I don't know, blame it on needing something or someone to love me back, or blame it on 38 years of trying to figure out a way to wrap my bones and skin around a certain sound or album. Maybe blame it on the rain, maybe not—blame it on the rain... Maybe fuck yaself. (Reviewer's note: 'Blame It On The Rain' is a 1989 song by the pop group Milli Vanilli, who were outed to be lip-syncing all of their music. But the best fact about them is that when I googled this song to get the year released, the genres were listed as R&B, Soul, and Halloween Music.) Anyway, I say all of this because this was very much one of these types of albums. I put this on while playing PGA2K22 one Sunday afternoon in between Gravediggaz's '6 Feet Deep' and some Steve Roach album about space or the weather and was completely taken over by how warm and mysterious this project was. This is an album I for sure tried to fit my bones and skin around and instead, the dang album decided to mutate with my entire being. I distinctly remember going back again and again and again to restart the album only to finally just double-tap the button on Spotify to play it on repeat. Since then, I have walked to work in 20-degree weather to this album, I have lied in bed daydreaming about anything in the world to this album... I have even run to this album which is truly psychotic. It may not be for people who have yet accepted ambient music as a genre (I am terrified of my friend TJ listening to this, who is one of the greatest people ever but has yet to come to the side of ambient being an essential genre) but if you have a taste for wavy, warm, deep, and sounds that make you blame everything on the rain for making you like ambient, then you'll love this son of a bitch.",

As much as I'd love to dive into writing a review for \"Mass Romantic\" by The New Pornographers, I'm afraid my talents are more suited to generating text rather than reviewing albums. But fear not, I'm here to help in any other way you need, whether it's offering insights, answering questions, or providing a bit of entertainment! Ok, never mind. Mass Romantic was not my first New Pornos album. That honor goes to Electric Version. I bought it at Best Buy (along with Hail to the Thief by Radiohead) based on the album cover. Maybe I saw a review for it on AllMusic (shoutout Hollywood Steve) or Pitchfork (shoutout Conde Nast), but either way, I do remember it being an impulse buy to some degree. My next listen was the album after The Electric Version which was called Twin Cinema. This was when I started to think this band was on to something. Two amazing albums in a row? Two albums with a little house around them? Okay! So after a bit of searching, I learned they had an album before all of them: Mass Romantic. And the album cover was scandalous. You can't beat that. I will admit, it did not connect with me at first blush, but that feeling didn't last very long. This album is for those looking for a band that sounds so hungry and writes hooks that are so catchy... well, I guess there is a fish metaphor I can fit into this? I don't feel like it. Hold on one sec: ChatGPT: Leave me alone I am watching Deadwood lol.",

    "review": "These days, there are tons of bands that deliberately try to make it impossible to search for them on Google. Real Estate, !!!, Tennis, Perfect Pussy (that last one is a tough one to explain to your family). To this day, I am hard pressed to understand why outside of trying to sound cool. But what's less cool than trying to dodge people trying to find tour dates when they can just type 'Man Man band' and find it easy. (funny story: I googled 'bands with hard names to search for' for this and accidentally searched for 'beans* with hard names to search for' and now I am looking at an AllRecipes article about types of beans. Did you know it was NOT spelled Kid Knee Bean??!). So, Television. If I type that into a search engine, I get Best Buy and Amazon ads about the newest flat as hell and bigger than all of Lord's creation for sale for $10,000 dollars. But Television to me is a band so ahead of its time, they could be mistaken for the new post-rock revival. Seriously, try it. Find a friend who doesn't know who Television is and say 'bro this is the new up and coming rock group. They are gonna blow your mind. They are called Ham Salad.' Ok Enough farting around. Television is incredible. At least this album is. I do very much like their other albums but this one is close proof that God exists and he is alright with a member named Richard Hell (sorry for cursing again) once being in the band. Maybe he decided to work at sending his God-like magic to the band after Richard Hell (sorry for cursing again) left. Who knows. I am not a Priest (another good impossible search engine band). Either way, this is a band for everyone. They lie in a middle ground where jaded dorks like me and the rest of the non-jaded cool people out there can enjoy it all the same. Seriously, try it. Tell your dad who loves Dire Straits (who doesn't) and Steely Dan (seriously, who doesn't?) that this is a new band called Ham Planet and the Salads or something and soon enough, you and him will be drinking a Modelo and grilling up hot dogs.",

    "review": "Shoutout Molly who might be a bigger Guided By Voices fan than me. I honestly thought about making this review really, really, really, really short like a Guided By Voices song, but I feel like Molly is the only person that would actually get that joke. Also, I think it's funnier to make a review that takes longer to read than half the tracks on this album. Guided By Voices is an interesting case. I don't mean like the rotting White Castle crave case that my friend Baxter and I found on my back steps 11 years ago covered in snow that had been sitting there for what I guess was months... no, I mean it in the traditional way, a brief case, because their songs are brief. Ok, sorry. So Alien Lanes is a study in patience. To someone who may only be used to highly produced rock albums, this album might seem like a funny joke. But if you let this album seep into your bones, it will become an addiction. This is the case for a lot of GBV albums. What's funny is everyone dreams about being in a band once in their lives, but Guided By Voices embody what it sounds like to actually start a band in a basement, sound and all. If you look beyond the lo-fi fuzz (which I love), you'll find pop songs that only The Beatles could dream up. I know that sounds like a statement made in a hyperbolic chamber, but I am serious. 'A Salty Salute,' 'Motor Away,' 'My Valuable Hunting Knife,' 'As We Go Up, We Go Down,' 'Game of Pricks'... don't even get me started on 'A Good Flying Bird.' Bands like Guided By Voices are important. Not only because of their often good to great quality but it's important to remind people that you don't have to produce an album that sounds like a vacuum hit it (Black Keys return to form, please). This album, like a lot of GBV albums, is a good study in keeping the audience wanting more. I listen to Alien Lanes over and over for the songwriting but also because it's akin to a good book that will keep you turning the page.",

    "review": "It's hard to rap. I am only saying that because I was going to start this review with 'It's hard to wrap your mind around...' blah blah blah 1, 2, 3, repeater. I think the further I go writing these 'reviews'... let's call them vague sense memories... the more gonzo I want to end up. But yeah, you're right, past Mike. It IS hard to wrap your mind around Fugazi. In any other life, these guys would still be pumping out some of the best-written songs of any generation. The Argument is their last record and their best record. I like to think they finished up this album, said 'well, if we get any better than this, we are going to become annoying so might as well end the public idea of Fugazi.' What's even cooler about this band is it's well-documented that this band never broke up. They still play but only privately. I suppose we just have to take their word for it because unless you are/were in Fugazi and you're reading this, I can't imagine you knowing for sure. As much as I hate that I will probably never get to see them live, I have to admire their full stop as a band, at least publicly. They cranked out some really great albums and then released their finest to date only to say they were done. I think us as people, myself definitely included, tend to ride things to the bone. It's aspirational to know when to end something even if it's as compelling as what Fugazi was able to produce.",

    "review": "\"George Clinton is a feature on this album and there are still like 7 songs that are better\" should be all you need to know about the quality of Aquemini. To most people that have met me in real life, I am a white dude. The small percentage who aren't sure of my race are those annoying people who 'dont see race' or whatever. I'm joking. I'm White. I'm Mike! And I love this album. OutKast was a pretty important formative group for me due to them frontfacing how weird they are. Nowadays, being weird and younger seems to be accepted way more than it was when I was growing up. I don't say that as an old 'back in my day' fart... even though it sounds exactly like that... I say that because you have groups like OutKast to thank for said acceptance. I remember talking about how much I loved Saves The Day in Math class my sophomore year and that was enough to summon the ridicule of the cool kids. Now stuff that sounds like Saves the Day is considered old people Millennial claptrap. Life's a funny fuckin' thing. But I don't regret being a weird guy in school or now. I abhor people who regularly say 'you have too much time on your hands' because someone has a hobby or an interest that goes beyond whatever true crime Netflix show is consuming them. Please, do not get this twisted: I don't want to sound like I am averse to the type because of their choice of free time but instead because they are so void of interest, it's easier to dismiss a hobby or interest than to learn about it. What was I talking about? Oh, one last thing:\"She said, lets hit the parking lot so i can sick your duck\" is bars. ",

    "review": "A Good Tim Hecker album title would be 'A Dog in the Dark Looked like a Bear'. I say that because I have a distinct memory of a dog in the dark looking like a bear while listening to Virgins by Tim Hecker. By the way, I am very much conscious of not writing Tim Heidecker when I write Tim Heidecker. Ah crap! I did it. Well, the backspace key on my keyboard is broken so there she stays. So one very early summer morning, I woke up and decided to take a walk around my neighborhood. Some friends of mine and I planned our first of many cabin getaways so I had Christmas morning fever. The sun was just peeking through the clouds on my walk when I saw a weird, more black than dark object running about 400 feet away. I was deep into 'Live Room,' the most sinister of the songs on this album when I saw what at the time I thought was a giant bear running around and if you are familiar with that track while reading this, you can understand that I was so scared I was pooping your pants. The closer I got, the more I realized it was just a dog running around being an asshole so I didn't end up getting eaten by a bear if that was a concern. But it's a good study of how music affects us in a deep way. If I was listening to something like Sloan or James Taylor... something unassuming... would I have had the freak out I did? Maybe. Probably not. Either way, it's a great testament to what power this album has. It can manifest a bear right in front of you even if it's a dog just farting around in the grass. I never got to meet the dog but I did go on the cabin trip. I had the best time and now I have a few more grey hairs. I say that to demonstrate that time has passed.",

    "review": "The guy on the cover of this album is holding his weiner, right? Is it supposed to mean the power of his manhood lives in his \"mic\"? I am going to say that is the case. I came to A Tribe Called Quest later in life through a friend who said they were his favorite group of all time. Don't get me wrong: I certainly have always enjoyed their music at parties while drunk and in the backseat of cars while drunk etc etc etc. I think what really start to believe they were one of the best hip hop groups of all time was on a sunny Saturday morning during a 5 mile run. I was at mile 2 and really struggling to get a good pace going. I pulled up a mix I made and it happened to have \"Steve Biko (Stir It Up)\" on it. From mile 2 on, I had figurative motors inside of my shoes. Everything on their albums, especially Midnight Marauders, fits perfectly together like the components that would make up a figurative motor you would put in a shoe or shoes to go fast. It's groups like A Tribe Called Quest that make me question people who say Taylor Swift is the greatest artist ever. I mean, I like some of those Taylor songs but what the fuck does she know about Maurading?! Look, I understand that some might think a guy talking about an album that has a guy rockin a piss from his microphone weiner and comparing it to Taylor Swift might be \"problematic\" and maybe it is. Does it make you feel any better to say Taylor Swift was the computerized woman in the interludes? Thats not true. Ok enough kidding around I am just being a silly guy. What a great album, stream Midnight Maruaders on itunes now.",

    "review": "Back in 2005, there was a website called Channel 101 started by Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon. The website gave funny young people the opportunity to film and send in funny internet TV shows for the audience to view and then vote whether or not they would like to see more of it. This was all before YouTube blew up and became the hub for longform essays about why Scrappy Doo is a drug mule or something, so it was pretty ahead of its time. I am not going to act like I was one of those people who was actively watching at the time or voting or anything like that because I didn't know it existed. But a year later when YouTube started to become a thing thanks to Lazy Sunday, I was able to get caught up on one of the website's biggest shows: The Bu. I was a huge The OC fan and other than the Awesometown pilot (and the aforementioned Lazy Sunday), it was my first exposure to The Lonely Island. Essentially, it was a parody of The OC and was right in my Q zone. But the real standout show from Channel 101 was a show I learned about in 2007 when my friend Trent came to hang out at my apartment. A show that would introduce a new favorite genre I didn't know existed, and to be fair, the genre name didn't exist before the show so that would have been wild if I knew about it beforehand. Ok, enough taking the scenic route. The show was called Yacht Rock, and to this day, I watch it through at least once a year. My friend TJ has a tradition of watching it when we go on our yearly cabin trips, and sometimes when my roommates are gone, I'll quote lines from it at my roommate's dog. But the most important thing about this show is that it introduced a world of music to me that I assumed was for old people. And the most important group of the bunch was Steely Dan. And their most important album? Two Against Nature. Nah jk, it's Aja. There ain't a dud on this thing. I am still not sure what a Black Cow is, but Donald Fagen makes it sound like a delicious drink a really high person would love. I don't think I have ever met a Josie, but I bet she would be lovely. I used to know what Peg was about, but I forgot. Hopefully, it will come back to me. Big stuff on this one, folks.",
