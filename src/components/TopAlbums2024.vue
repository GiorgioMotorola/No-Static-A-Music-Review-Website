', desc: 'Big Thief was a group I didn\'t get at first. Around the time UFOF and Two Hands came out, I would see rave reviews by every publication, see their albums on the display wall at my local record stores, and listen to friends talk ad nauseam about how great they were. To me, they were just a folksy indie rock band with a nice-sounding lead singer. But around the time Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You came out, I was hooked. I finally got it. The band wasn\'t just a nice voice and some sparse instrumentation... they were a dialed-in songwriting machine. Adrianne Lenker continues their crusade on the masses of showing off how they were born to be a musician with their newest solo project New Bright Future. A beautiful, heartbreaking and sometimes very catchy monster of an album that continues the tradition of Adrianne Lenker doing what they do best. ' },
        { rank: '49',cover: './albums2024/stvin.jpg', title: 'All Born Screaming', artist: 'St. Vincent', videoId: 'BWkxzcWt51w', genre: 'Art Rock, Art Pop, Neo-Psychedelia', soundsLike:'art shows, Johnathon Demme music documentaries and coffee shops that serve weird drinks.',  desc: 'Starting out her career as a member of Polyphonic Spree (good god remember those guys?) and as a backing member of Sufjan Stevens\' band, Anne Clark aka St. Vincent continues to write angular art pop that David Byrne would kill to have written. Her latest album is her most engaging and wild, with big and loud guitar solos slicing through bright choruses layered like angel harmonies that God would kill to have written. But God wouldn\'t dare because St. Vincent would most likely beat God up first. All I am saying is if there was a fight between Anne Clark and any being, I would confidently bet on her walking away with maybe a scratch and a handful of cool artsy songs for her next album. St. Vincent lives in our hearts and she lives in my walls help me I am terrified.' },
        { rank: '48',cover: './albums2024/chrom.jpg', title: 'CHROMAKOPIA', artist: 'Tyler, The Creator', videoId: '16KSivdIGjQ', genre: 'West Coast Hip Hop, Experimental Hip Hop', soundsLike:'a fancy persons party you would see in a tv show where everyone is wearing nice jackets and holding drinks that look way too bright.',  desc: 'Tyler, the Creator has come a really, really reaaaaalllly long way from his days as the deep-voiced, cockroach-eating leader of Odd Future. He has done the opposite of what most artists do and put out not-so-great solo albums for a number of years and then, as if a light switch was snapped, became one of the most interesting and engaging Hip Hop artists to do it. On his new effort, he writes bold marching band beat mini movies built to withstand an atomic bomb. Or a cherry bomb, I guess in this case. He has taken the idea of an album rollout, which in my opinion can often come off as a narcissistic endeavor, and creates new characters like he is Mike Myers but not Canadian and with fewer silly voices but still brings something unique to the table."' },
        { rank: '47',cover: './albums2024/inwaves.png', title: 'In Waves', artist: 'Jamie xx', videoId: 'xeKSdJqFM6o', genre: 'House, Future Garage, UK Bass', soundsLike:'a house party at 1am where everyone is drunk but not too drunk to puke everywhere.',  desc: 'House producer extraordinaire Jamie xx returns after nearly ten years (cue Jeremy Piven from Grosse Pointe Blank shouting \"TEN YEARS! TEN\") to give us something that might not be superior to In Colour but certainly ain\'t something you would kick outta bed for eating crackers. As a matter of fact, if In Colour didn\'t exist, this album would have been talked about much more this year. But that\'s what happens when you take your time and try to follow up a masterpiece. Regardless, this album is a fun, texture-rich house album that\'s gonna get even those who aren\'t fans of electronic music tapping their toes. Just listen to Baddie on the Floor and tell me that song isn\'t gonna be on your running playlist for the next lifetime.' },
        { rank: '46',cover: './albums2024/manning.png', title: 'Manning Fireworks', artist: 'MJ Lenderman', videoId: 'YeGujHpGUIs', genre: 'Alt-Country, Slacker Rock', soundsLike:'a warm summer night on a porch drinking bourbon',  desc: 'Our beloved zoomers\' answer to Jeff Tweedy comes in the form of a man who has a funny face. Good thing that face makes him money. MJ Lenderman has been combining early Wilco with Pavement but with a small dash of Midwest Emo for quite some time and his new album is proof it\'s working. These are songs that would have fit in perfectly on Car Wheels on a Gravel Road by Lucinda Williams. They hang in the air like dust in a sunbeam or some other dirt road poetry this guy would lazily drip out of his mouth during a slide guitar solo. This guy is either gonna end up with a cult following or put something out that will have a world-shaking impact. But for now, just sit in a chair with some cheap bourbon and listen.' },
        { rank: '45',cover: './albums2024/jpeg.png', title: 'I LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR YOU', artist: 'JPEGMAFIA', videoId: 'Ua_xNmwNbqY', genre: 'Experimental Hip Hop, Hardcore Hip Hop', soundsLike:'scaring the hoes',  desc: '\"JPEGMAFIA sounds like a computer\" would be a hilarious insult from an old grandpa if it wasn\'t sort of true. Peggy has spent the last 17 or so years making a mess sound incredible. He could have just gone the Alchemist route and made beats for Experimental Hip Hop artists and gone down as one of the greatest to ever do it. But not one to rest on his laurels, (I assume. I don\'t know the guy) he takes it a step further and pairs his beats with bars that sound lifted out of a long-forgotten 4chan thread. This new one has him mixing what he does best with rock samples and makes it work somehow. It\'s hard to make Rap Rock work but if one guy could do it, it\'s Peggy.' },
        { rank: '44',cover: './albums2024/35.png', title: '3 + 5', artist: 'Melt-Banana', videoId: 'ix_lYiFzMw0', genre: 'Noise Rock, Hardcore Punk, Experimental Rock', soundsLike:'the basement of your favorite anime store where they sell blood',  desc: 'I am not an anime fan, not even a little bit. It might be my age or the fact that animated content never really did it for me outside of when I was 5 years old and loved Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but no man ever steps in the same river twice, for it\'s not the same river and he\'s not the same man. That being said, I am a weeb for Japanese music: all forms of Jazz, City Pop, Metal, Punk, Ambient... it all taps right into my Q zone. Melt Banana sounds like one of those J Pop songs you would hear in your favorite anime about a guy who can... I don\'t know, eat a lot of hot dogs and turn into a hot dog superhero or something... and put it at a noise rock fever pitch. Melt Banana has ruled and will continue to rule. This new album is a testament to that.' },
        { rank: '43',cover: './albums2024/allhell.jpg', title: 'All Hell', artist: 'Los Campesinos!', videoId: 'kk4UCP9vlA0', genre: 'Post-Punk Revival, Midwest Emo, Art Rock ', soundsLike:'meeting old friends after 10 years and counting the grey hairs on their head.',  desc: 'Los Campesinos! and I go way back. I was on board when they started getting coverage on Pitchfork and have at least listened to their new releases once or twice since. That being said, after Romance Is Boring, their albums could have been added to that list of things that are boring. They were still fine enough efforts, but it felt like the magic was gone. But baby, we are so back. These Welsh goofballs figured it out. It\'s hard to age in a world that\'s always changing, but it\'s even harder to figure out how to continue fitting in. But Los Campesinos somehow worked it all out and made an album that feels like a sore back and being 21 again.' },
        { rank: '42',cover: './albums2024/boldy1.jpg', title: 'Across The Tracks', artist: 'Boldy James & Conductor Williams', videoId: 'sSD_YS9FZjI', genre: 'Gangsta Rap, Boom Bap', soundsLike:'night time on a road trip. Its cold outside but the heat in the car works just fine. ',  desc: 'Boldy James is my guy right now. The patrons over at AOTY seem to think the guy releases too much music, but if that were the case, how will I get my two to three Boldy James albums a year if he chills out? I know, familiarity breeds contempt and all that, but Boldy is constantly working with different producers trying to carve his smooth, deadpan flow right into the side of their beats, so every release often feels fresh. He released two albums this year, and both earned a spot on my list. I am sure he is very happy to hear that. Him and I are good friends. Just kidding.' },
        { rank: '41',cover: './albums2024/whylawd.jpg', title: 'WHY LAWD?', artist: 'NxWorries', videoId: 'T741gjLy0LM', genre: 'Contemporary R&B, West Coast Hip Hop, Psychedelic Soul, Smooth Soul', soundsLike:'a smooth car ride thru a neon painted city',  desc: 'Do you guys remember the FlyLo radio station in GTA V? Man, I spent days of my very unimpressive life driving around listening to that station over and over again. Flying Lotus has a way of digging deep into what makes a song soulful, ripping the guts out and rearranging them into something bigger than the sum of its parts so giving him the authority to currate his own radio station is kind of a no brainer. FlyLo is not part of NxWorries but when producer Knxwledge and artist Anderson .Paak get together, it reminds me deeply of the feeling I had listening to that radio station driving around some beat up car I stole off of some old lady and that is truly a special feeling. ' },
        { rank: '40',cover: './albums2024/sam.jpg', title: 'Samurai', artist: 'Lupe Fiasco', videoId: 'MTMyoVt5GHs', genre: 'Jazz Rap, Abstract Hip Hop', soundsLike:'what the inside of a backpack rappers backpack sounds like but a little better',  desc: 'The reason artists of any type fall so hard from grace is because they find their lane and stay in it until the car breaks down. The reason Lupe Fiasco is still cruising along is his ability to try new stuff. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn\'t. This album absolutely works. At this point I assume you know the conceptual wrap for this project, but just in case you don\'t, here it is: This album is \"what if Amy Winehouse but she was a battle rapper?\" That\'s it. It\'s a ridiculous premise but Lupe makes it work very well. It\'s funny enough to be interesting and the album sounds great enough to keep you around. I can\'t wait until Westside Gunn writes his album about Britney Spears becoming a member of the Costco guys.' },
        { rank: '39',cover: './albums2024/healer.jpg', title: 'The Healer', artist: 'Sumac', videoId: '2VdGdQ6MtXc', genre: 'Atmospheric Sludge Metal, Avant-Garde Metal', soundsLike:'see the long winded, gross first part of the album description above',  desc: 'Imagine if the Melvins decided to go all in on what it means to make Sludge Metal music. They took the riffs deeper, made them slow forever, and then threw them inside of a swamp made of black sticky goo, blended it up, and then fed it to their amps. Then they took those amps and ate them and did a number two inside of that swamp again... okay, this analogy has gone too deep into the woods, but I am sure you get what I mean. This album is HEAVY so make sure your bass is up and your butt has something to hold on to.' },
        { rank: '38',cover: './albums2024/dtimes.png', title: 'Dark Times', artist: 'Vince Staples', videoId: '-VjAeaGu5x4', genre: 'Conscious Hip Hop, West Coast Hip Hop', soundsLike:'a glass of wine in a clean home thats well lit, being at peace with everything',  desc: 'Like most of the other hip hop artists on this list, Vince Staples isn\'t one to stay in one spot. The only difference between him and the other guys is he makes it look super easy. He almost sounds bored sometimes. But that\'s kind of his thing. He doesn\'t give a freaking crap about anything! I think a lot of people think they are going through life with no regard for anything or anyone, but if we are being honest with ourselves, we have plenty we care about. I don\'t know if that\'s the case for Vince Staples. But that\'s what makes him so appealing. He is the guy we all want to be, effortlessly making something great and then going home and probably just hanging out on his couch watching sports or The Office or something.' },
        { rank: '37',cover: './albums2024/highway.jpg', title: 'Highway Prayers', artist: 'Billy Strings', videoId: 'oTF-fD7eVcU', genre: 'Progressive Bluegrass', soundsLike:'a good ol hoedown in a barn thats on a different planet',  desc: 'For a few years of my life, I would go to this Folk and Bluegrass festival called Whispering Beard with some friends on what was usually the hottest days of the year. It was sweaty and exhausting, but it was always the high point of that year. The beer tasted better, my friend Connor would drink a jug of wine with hopes to be asked on stage to play a jug solo, and the creek water felt nice on my gross feet. Any time I listen to bluegrass, it takes me back to that time. Highway Prayers is like that feeling distilled into a grain alcohol that\'s strong but smooth. But don\'t drink too much or you might join a jug band! (Also, alcohol should be used sparingly; it\'s very bad for you.)' },
        { rank: '36',cover: './albums2024/fearless.png', title: 'Fearless Movement', artist: 'Kamasi Washington', videoId: 'nxMolO9CEaU', genre: 'Spiritual Jazz, Jazz Fusion', soundsLike:'a warm fireplace on a snowy Christmas Eve',  desc: 'Jazz isn\'t dead. Sure, it\'s not the dominating musical force it may have been in the early days of modern day America, but there are still artists out there willing to put out challenging jazz music for people who are into that sort of thing. Kamasi Washington has been and still is one of those guys. On Fearless Movement, he attempts to modernize the idea of jazz by interspersing and smashing other genres into what is considered the thinking man\'s genre. He also has Andre 3000 playing the dang flute on this thing, which for my money is enough to make me listen.' },
        { rank: '35',cover: './albums2024/theart.jpg', title: 'Tarantula Heart', artist: 'Melvins', videoId: 'Fsd8gDGSSKU', genre: 'Sludge Metal', soundsLike:'See that description for Sumacs The Healer but with more swing than sludge',  desc: 'You gotta love the Melvins. They have essentially done a variation on a theme for their entire 40-year career. Now, I know I have spent a lot of time talking about how in order for an artist or band or whatever to stay interesting and relevant, they have to try new things, but the Melvins are the exception to the rule. If it ain\'t broke, fix it. And if it is broke, add more fuzz and reverb. They are an evergreen in Rock and Metal music and can always be a sturdy post to lean on for every release. Not much else to say, just the Melvins doing what they do best.' },
        { rank: '34',cover: './albums2024/silence.jpg', title: 'The Closest Thing to Silence', artist: 'Ariel Kalma, Jeremiah Chiu & Marta Sofia Honer', videoId: 'b1B2dukuz_Y', genre: 'Ambient, Progressive Electronic', soundsLike:'Blade Runners cooler cousin, Blade Walker',  desc: 'Ambient music is one of my favorite genres of all time. I understand not everyone gets it, and that\'s fine, but allow me to try and sell it: Imagine all the movies you have watched that have soundtracks with what you might consider incidental music. Blade Runner, Drive, The Social Network, The Firm, etc. Now replace that soundtrack with something like Sugar Ray or Mighty Mighty Bosstones. While on an ironic level, that might be a funny idea, it certainly would change the vibe, right? So take that hidden feeling ambient music gives you while watching a classic movie and take away the movie. Now ambient is the movie now. I honestly don\'t know where I was going with this. This album is great. Awesome texture. You\'ll love it if you love Ambient and Progressive Electronic.' },
        { rank: '33',cover: './albums2024/mind.jpg', title: 'Mind Yo Fucking Business', artist: 'RXKNephew', videoId: 'tNXywRs6xMQ', genre: 'Hardcore Hip Hop', soundsLike:'The Comedy Store but actually funny. Take that, Pauly Shores ugly mom. ',  desc: 'Neph is a deeply funny guy. The way he raps, what he raps about... he could headline clubs. But his music isn\'t a joke. It might be funny like They Might Be Giants, but like They Might Be Giants, the primary focus is on how it sounds. You may laugh at song titles like “Punch Yo Father Out,” “Imma Drink Everyday,” and “Put You In A Wheelchair,” but it\'s going to be catchy and it\'s going to be fun. It\'s hard to say where RXKNephew will be in 5 years, but I wouldn\'t be shocked if it wasn\'t on the year-end list of every publication that has slept on him for so long. Also, as a side note, if you don\'t got that dawg in you, maybe sit this one out.' },
        { rank: '32',cover: './albums2024/three.png', title: 'Three', artist: 'Four Tet', videoId: 'DGaKVLFNWzs', genre: 'Microhouse, Folktronica, Ambient', soundsLike:'a nice spring morning jog where your pace is perfect',  desc: 'Four Tet is another evergreen. He is like the Melvins in the fact that whatever he decides to do, I will be there first thing and I will probably like it. The only difference is what he does is delicate and thoughtful. Upon first listen of any Four Tet album, you dig up a few things here and there that might be of use, but if you keep digging, you\'ll strike gold. Or oil. Or an old wrestling action figure you buried when you were a kid because the character died in your fake wrestling federation. The balancing act Four Tet performs between confident experimentation and pop-like hooks is admirable and he can\'t keep getting away with it.' },
        { rank: '31',cover: './albums2024/liquidmike.jpg', title: 'Paul Bunyan\'s Slingshot', artist: 'Liquid Mike', videoId: 'lltlvniBPkI', genre: 'Power Pop, Pop Punk', soundsLike:'the friday evening before getting to a house party where everyone there is someone you love',  desc: 'Hello, my name is Liquid Mike. Just kidding. The band is called Liquid Mike. I am not sure if anyone in the band is actually named Mike or if all of the members are named Mike, but it doesn\'t matter. This is a power pop titan. It\'s 25 minutes and some change worth of some of the catchiest stuff that has come out this year. Big hooks, crunchy and cool-sounding guitars, and the replayability of a Teenage Fanclub or Fountains of Wayne album. Dashed in with a tiny bit of pop punk, and you have a record that will live on and stand tall among the Joyce Manors of the world.' },
        { rank: '30',cover: './albums2024/leadership.jpg', title: 'Penalty of Leadership', artist: 'Boldy James & Nicholas Craven', videoId: 'sPHkRyiuu-w', genre: 'Gangsta Rap, Drumless', soundsLike:'Just go listen to the guy already will ya?',  desc: 'This is the second Boldy James album. Its great. What do you want from me?' },
        { rank: '29',cover: './albums2024/cool.png', title: 'Cool World', artist: 'Chat Pile', videoId: '6T8s1G3ku2I', genre: 'Noise Rock, Sludge Metal', soundsLike:'dissonant, death, destruction, autumn time :)',  desc: 'Hello, I Am Dog Now. Just kidding. I don\'t know if anyone in Chat Pile is a dog for real, but it really doesn\'t matter. Chat Pile is a newer group that seems to be getting darker and heavier. And as Garth Brooks would say after joining Facebook for the first time, “I like that.” They have the confidence of the dumbest lug head you have ever met in your life with the talent of the masters of their craft. And as Garth Brooks would further say after joining Facebook for the first time, “I really like that.” So if this is the future of sludge metal and punk, then I say “let the sludge metal and punk begin” or something.' },
        { rank: '28',cover: './albums2024/action.jpg', title: 'JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACHLAVA THE DOCTOR', artist: 'Action Bronson', videoId: 'R3jqt_s9MpU', genre: 'East Coast Hip Hop, Drumless, Jazz Rap', soundsLike:'a smooth afternoon with people who are a bit cooler than you are',  desc: 'He cooks! He Raps. He says funny crap! He is the perfect example of someone who probably wouldnt have left New York if youtube didnt exist but I sure am glad it does. Action Bronson is a pretty lovable guy. Sure, his album output can sometimes be a bit spotty but when he hits, he hits. Furthermore, the past few years for him has seemed like sort of a rebirth. He has gotten into better shape, a bit more of the limelight within the mainstream world and has come back to making really cool music. I just hope he doesnt read this because if he would probably beat me up. ' },
        { rank: '27',cover: './albums2024/upper.jpg', title: 'Upper Space', artist: 'DJ Rude One', videoId: 'K2FWndhR3aY', genre: 'Hip-Hop/Rap, Boom Bap', soundsLike:'what I imagine every New York basement studio sounds like',  desc: 'Full disclosure: I know DJ Rude One, or as my phone knows him: Rick. But if I didn\'t know this guy, this album would have still made my list. I love it when friends of mine go after something they want, and all the better when they make it work. DJ Rude One has worked with some of the biggest up-and-coming rappers and has given each and every one of them a sturdy stage made up of dark and grimy boom bap to do their thing on. This is his finest work yet. In all seriousness, if Rick doesn\'t blow up and act like he don\'t know me in a few years, I will eat my own hat.' },
        { rank: '26',cover: './albums2024/beak.jpg', title: '>>>>', artist: 'Beak>', videoId: 'IQ-tAOFvofU', genre: 'Krautrock, Post-Rock', soundsLike:'a trip in space on a spaceship with Neu! and CAN',  desc: 'Made up of members of Portishead and Sensational Space Shifters, Beak> takes krautrock and brings it into the present by ironically making it sound like a lost post-rock classic from the 60s. This one is patient, spacy, and lives inside a large room, bouncing around nothing and everything at the same time. That might be too busy of a description to fully grasp what I am getting at, but it\'s my list, and I\'ll do whatever I want to. No one is reading this anyway. Maybe TJ, maybe my Dad. Hey guys, hope your day is nice.' },
        { rank: '25',cover: './albums2024/something.jpg', title: 'Something in the Room She Moves', artist: 'Julia Holter', videoId: 'D36Zt7yy2OY', genre: 'Art Pop, Chamber Jazz', soundsLike:'a perfume that is classy but you can\t quite nail down what it smells like',  desc: 'If Björk, Harold Budd, and Sade all had a baby, then that would be big news because I\'m not sure how that would work. Unless they adopted a baby. Ok, let\'s say if Björk, Harold Budd, and Sade pooled their money and adopted a baby from the guy from Blue Nile, it would be this album. But babies can\'t be albums. So, I guess if they took that baby and that baby grew up to write this album, it would be this album. Yeah, that\'s what I meant to write initially. Also, that baby I guess would have to be Julia Holter.' },
        { rank: '24',cover: './albums2024/city.jpg', title: 'City Swamp', artist: 'Jake Long', videoId: 'pHKn9F_NwYQ', genre: 'Jazz Fusion, Jazz-Funk', soundsLike:'a seedy, smoky bar in a metropolitan city',  desc: 'If you were to see the album cover on this son of a gun, you would assume it would sound like some nightmarish hellscape, brutal death metal, or at the very least, some nasty hardcore punk. But in reality, what you have with City Swamp by Jake Long is a fantastical Jazz Funk romp made for those dark nights of the soul. This album is meant to boost your spirit and pull you out of any funk with funk, soul, jazz, and just a touch of psychedelic ambient rock. If that doesn\'t make sense, good. Go listen to it and thank me later. Or don\'t. I don\'t care.' },
        { rank: '23',cover: './albums2024/night.jpg', title: 'Night Palace', artist: 'Mount Eerie', videoId: 'iyYDdVxDJOg', genre: 'Avant-Folk, Slacker Rock, Post-Rock', soundsLike:'like the guy said above: it sounds like what the album cover looks like. Do I need to hold your hand thru everything?',  desc: 'One of my biggest mistakes was calling into work sick and while dying in my bed, putting on A Crow Looked At Me by Mount Eerie. I don\'t intend on going into what that album is all about here because, frankly, it\'s a mega bummer. But it\'s nice to be reminded that music can still have a huge impact on you after years and years of listening. This album isn\'t as much of a bummer but more of an escape. The album cover looks like it sounds: a stormy, sometimes peaceful, sometimes raucous affair made for an island in the dark. It\'s a long run length but I swear you won\'t tell because of how many twists and turns this album has. Just maybe hold off on A Crow Looked At Me unless you are prepared to be bummed out.' },
        { rank: '22',cover: './albums2024/lightdeath.png', title: 'Light Of Death', artist: 'Umbra Vitae', videoId: 'BkxjiJKn-4k', genre: 'Deathcore, Death Metal', soundsLike:'Converge but with scarier, more aggresive moments',  desc: 'I really hate this album cover, so you know. But don\'t let that deter you from listening to what essentially is Converge with extra riffs. Fronted by Converge lead singer Jacob Bannon and members of Hatebreed, Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats, and The Red Chord, this is a very fun, very rowdy Death Metal album. Starting out like the THX theme with dissonant strings and never letting up after, this one is for the fans of being slammed in the head with noise over and over and over until you pass out.' },
        { rank: '21',cover: './albums2024/nail.jpg', title: 'Every Bridge Burning', artist: 'Nails', videoId: 'PAmBKEDUG5M', genre: 'Grindcore, Powerviolence', soundsLike:'Phil Spector if is Wall of Sound was built out of bones and sharp metal ',  desc: 'We got another one! This year has been a solid year for Metal and when Nails releases, you know it\'s going to be well worth the listen. Another example of a band that may be stuck in the lane they started in but to be honest, like the Melvins, when you do it this well, why change? Of course, this album is in and out in under 20 minutes like a guy who has to show up to a birthday dinner so he doesn\'t hear about it later. You eat bolts and nuts and nails by the handful, say happy birthday, punch a couple walls, flip over a table and then get into your monster truck and drive home. And with this album being so short, it\'s a pretty non-committal affair which means it\'s technically less restrictive than going to a birthday party. You don\'t even have to leave the house!' },
        { rank: '20',cover: './albums2024/ka.png', title: 'The Thief Next to Jesus', artist: 'KA', videoId: 'l4oPd6lGFK0', genre: 'Abstract Hip Hop, Drumless, East Coast Hip Hop', soundsLike:'the gospel according to a thoughful, soft spoken Jesus',  desc: 'Ka died a couple of months after this album\'s release. It was public knowledge before then that the publicly shy hip-hop artist was a New York City Firefighter and continued to be while releasing his brand of drumless, incredibly hypnotizing work. After his death, however, it was revealed the guy was a first responder during the World Trade Center attacks. It\'s incredible that people out there can go through what might be the scariest moment of anyone\'s life and still have the capacity to focus enough for albums of his caliber. But I suppose that\'s what made the dude so special. It sucks he passed away but I suppose leaving a legacy like he did isn\'t all half bad and a thousand times bigger of a legacy than I will probably leave. Unless I die in space fighting space terrorism or something.' },

His persona is that of the rock stars of the 60s, 70s, and the 80s, but he writes music that\'s more akin to a Randy Newman or a Warren Zevon. It\'s very possible his new album might be his best (although I still have a soft spot for *Pure Comedy*) and it certainly is his tightest. With only 8 tracks and 50 minutes, Father John Misty makes it known that his place at the top of the Indie Folk Mountain is secure and set for a long, long time.' },

Well, you get Motörhead, of course. And what do you get when Motörhead gains popularity and notoriety that even Wal-Mart sells their T-shirts? You have High on Fire. Not to say that High on Fire shops exclusively at Wal-Mart or even found out about Motörhead at Wal-Mart. But you can certainly tell they love Motörhead in their music. This is probably the closest you\'ll get to what Motörhead did in their incredibly long run up until Lemmy\'s death. But don\'t mistake this for a band biting their style. High on Fire stands on their own island of Metal Punk and deserve the respect they get like this album deserves to be on everyone\'s Spotify Wrapped.' },

This is the first year I had heard of Ulcerate but they apparently have been kicking around for almost 20 years. But what an introduction Cutting the Throat of God is. This is a dark, scary, astonishing work of art that is meant to be played incredibly loud to where your brain slips out of your ears. I am certain this album will be an influence to the up and coming Death Metal acts in the next 5 or 10 years and it will certainly be an album I come back to when I need a little sense knocked into me.' },

Not the band Fun but like, fun? I used to have so much fun all the time and then I got a job and responsibilities so my fun is usually channeled in doing stuff like this or playing video games or something. I feel both ancient and young when I listen to NO HANDS by Joey Valence and Brae. This album is fun. There isn’t much else to be said about it other than if you are a Beastie Boys fan, you’re going to love this album. It’s fun. Honestly, there truly isn’t much else to say. Go listen and have a good time, idiot.' },

Then I stumbled onto 1686 by Ekathe, and it fit right in. This album doesn’t mess around with gimmicks or genre-blending. It’s just solid grooves, pure and simple. If you’re into that smooth, no-frills jazz fusion sound, this one’s a must. I had it on repeat for hours. Sometimes, that’s all you need\u2014just a great, infectious groove that takes you on a journey. Definitely one of my favorite finds this year.' },

Well, that\'s crazy you\'ll believe anything. Ex-Easter Island Head is actually from the UK and as far as I can tell, none of the members are initially from Easter Island. It\'s very possible that at least one or maybe all of them have been there but who\'s to say. What I can say is Ex-Easter Island Head is a very cool experimentation in drone music made with live instrumentation. Of course, Sunn O\\)\\), Battles, and nearly the entire whole of Krautrock have been doing this for years but what this band does seems a bit classier. This album should be listened to with a full orchestra backing them up but they don\'t need it. Just 4 guys making very engaging and incredibly pretty music that\'s made for any moment of the day. I implore you to find a nice morning where you don\'t have much to do, take a walk, and put this album on. It\'ll be a great way to start the day.' },

That album was love at first sight. I love that album more than a lot of people I know. I love the warmth, simplicity, and sharpness of that album. But the problem is, when you hear an album that\'s as unique as For Those of You Who Have Never \\(And Also Those Who Have\\), you\'re going to have a hard time finding a good counterpart to it. Searching by James Devane is a great album and while it doesn\'t exactly scratch that itch, it gets pretty close. This thing has repeating melodies that sound like they have been aged in fine wine over some percussion that is ready for the floor and weird short introductions that feed directly from the last track into the next one. It comes off as sounding like a satellite dish trying to locate signs of life but coming up short so often, it starts writing Ambient Dub music to keep itself entertained.' },

It\'s incredible that Freddie is from Gary, Indiana because this thing sounds like it was born in the Bay or Long Beach or wherever that good West Coast hip hop comes from. Personally, I don\'t think Freddie Gibbs has a bad album and instead has albums that sit on a gradient of good all the way to classic. Maybe one day he will prove me wrong and put out a stinker but I honestly don\'t think that\'s going to happen since it appears the man can do no wrong. The only bummer is they released my favorite track \"It\'s Your Anniversary\" off of streaming \\(I assume due to sample issues\\) but that doesn\'t take away how great of a listen this is overall.' },

And Metal album covers? Come on, look at the album cover for Maze Envy by Civerous. It speaks directly to the music. It\'s loud, big, terrifying, and disorienting but all in the best ways possible. The real champ for this album is the production. Somehow, they made something so disgusting and sharp sound warm and full. And if none of that does it for you, the drumming on this album is top-tier perfection. This one is a must for all Death Metal fans.' },

It has been a FANTASTIC year for Metal and this here at my 10 spot is what I would like to call \"baby\'s first Death Metal record\". I certainly do not mean that in any disparaging way. But Blood Incantation has that effect on their songwriting. They somehow, album after album, make music that\'s typically an acquired taste and can make it enjoyable for almost anyone. You want a Metal album that sounds like you\'re fighting a space war? What about an album that features Progressive Electronic legends Tangerine Dream? What about an album with some of the sickest album art on the planet? Then this is your album.' },

It has been a pretty decent year for Metal to be honest and 2. It\'s always impressive when a band takes an often hard-to-get-into genre and makes it accessible. Avant Garde Metal is a bear to fight for some. It\'s often more experimental and darker, takes a lot of cues from Jazz but Oranssi Pazuzu with every passing album tends to soften the features up just enough to let newcomers in while still sounding scary and aggressive. Their previous album Mastarin Kynsi is one of my favorite Metal albums of all time and this one is certainly doing a lot for me as well. Give this one a shot if you are looking for something terrifying but palatable in the grand scheme of things' },

Let\'s take it back to the pretty stuff. Nala Sinephro is probably a genius. She is a Belgian jazz musician who often plays the harp on her albums but for Endlessness, she decided to make the Tangerine Dream album those guys always probably maybe wanted to make. What really stands out to me is the variation on a theme similar to other amazing ambient-esque jazz record Promises by Pharoah Sanders, Floating Points, and the London Symphony Orchestra. As a matter of fact, if you are a fan of that album and haven\'t heard this album, then this is your new favorite album. If you aren\'t familiar with either, then I don\'t know what you are doing with your life. If you love both well then, welcome, brother or sister. We finally made it to the apex of lush beauty.' },

Sure I loved plenty of other types of music but I was pretty much married to the genres at one point. But as you get older and your tastes expand or you want something a bit more leftfield, you find your place in other forms of sound. Spirit of the Beehive certainly must feel the same way as I do. Sure, this is an Indie Pop record but the way it twists and turns between different sounds before you can even tie your left shoe is all I need to know that this group is trying to dig for something deeper in a genre that has already been drained to its core. There is something mysterious about these songs. They feel so welcoming but at the same time, they feel clammy to the ear or alien. With every listen, there is something new to fall in love with and with every other listen, there is something that you loved that presents a new reason to love it. It\'s a perfect gift for anyone who is looking for something a bit deeper but maybe not completely out of their comfort zone.' },

It can get exhausting after a while. Sometimes I just want something that sounds good and that\'s executed to near perfection. For the past 11 or so years, Kendrick Lamar has been throwing grand statements at us and while he usually hits the nail on the head, it\'s easy to forget that he is at his core a musician who likes to write music that can touch a large swath of the population. Along with having a prime year with the Drake beef, Kendrick released his love letter to fun Rap music from the west coast. GNX could have a deeper meaning that I am not seeing and it could be his biggest puzzle yet but to be honest, these songs are so much fun that I honestly don\'t care. I am sure he will get back to wowing everyone with his genius soon enough but man it feels good to just have a nice time again with my dang brain off.' },

I don\'t know how much Metal you listen to, dear reader, but if you envy living in a time where late 80\'s to early 90\'s Death Metal was scaring the parents and turning the kids into demons while sounding as simple as it could, well then do I have an album for you. Manual Manic Procedures by 200 Stan Wounds not only put out probably the most gruesome album cover of 2024 but the best Metal album of the year. Coming in at just under 30 minutes, this bad boy takes you back to the sound of Death, Morbid Angel, Entombed and Carcass while sounding as fresh as can be. It\'s full-on uncompromising, nasty, fast and brutal. Good lord, what a spectacular year for Metal.' },

I honestly dont know why but I would plant so many seeds to this I bet',  desc: 'Mach-Hommy is the thinking man\'s Griselda-ian. Not to say that Westside Gunn, Conway the Machine and the rest aren\'t smart but Mach-Hommy makes it known that he is always 20 steps ahead with his music. This album is wavy and secretly kind of brilliant. It sounds like a night out and a French art film all at the same time. Samples that sound like Spaghetti Westerns and lyrics that zoom by way too quick to appreciate how smart they are, I can see this being a classic for a long time to come.' },

There isn\'t a band going right now that is doing pop music as good as they are and I mean that with my entire chest. The duo has been writing music for mix cd\'s for a few years now and they already sound like they have been at it for 50 years. In a world where Glitchpop and Hyperpop have essentially become mainstream thanks to Charli XCX (yes I like that album but it\'s been a great year, cut me some slack that it isn\'t going to make the list), these two are instead distilling what makes those microgenres so engaging and putting them together with a swirl of Psychedelia. There is NO ONE that sounds like them and they make music sound extraordinary.' },

I remember finding leaks of their demos just before their first full length and already knowing I was going to ride with this band for the rest of my life. But I assumed their peak had already passed. Boy was I wrong. I first heard this album with my best friend TJ at a cabin the minute it was released. At first, I didn\'t know what to make of it. Sure, it was good but after a couple more listens, it was pretty apparent this was their best record by a long shot. It\'s just experimental enough not to lose the plot, nostalgic enough to keep everything on the tracks and all out what I was not expecting for a band that has already done so much. An Instant classic.' },

The best album of 2024. Honestly, I wasn\'t surprised I love this album as much as I did after the first listen. Geordie Greep has been impressing us for a few years with his work in Black MIDI but after they broke up and he announced his solo album, it could have gone sideways very easily. This is an internet band. The internet weirdos love this band and if he screwed up even just a little, it would have been over. But instead, he took Steely Dan and turned it up to 11. All the perv deadbeats that Donald Fagen sang about for years would be grossed out by Geordie\'s lowlifes. This album is full of so many ideas that it\'s about to pop but somehow it pulls it off. It\'s so close to the line of disaster that it has to be respected. Geordie Greep may go on to release a career of middling material but this album will go down as a perfect debut from an already impressive artist. But let\'s be honest: I think we all know we can expect huge things from this kid for years to come.' },
